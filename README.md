# Mods
I play games.

I play modded games.

I play single player games 99% of the time.

Old games, new games, but not typically first person SHOOTERS, but, computers change, my configs change, hard drives change, and some games have things that I don't want to reproduce all over again.

Although I understand the WHY, I just don't like multi-block building that Immersive Engineering does.  It's easy enough, but sometimes trying to figure out what's what, and some mod packs messing up the blueprints, just causes a bit of frustration I have.  Beleive me, I get it, I understand it, I can deal, just... It's easier for the computer to do the remembering. ;)
